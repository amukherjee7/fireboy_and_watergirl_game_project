This project was created in spring 2024 by me and 2 friends in my school's Intro to Java class. We were tasked to recreate a popular game from scratch using our skills
in Java, and we chose to recreate the iconic game, Fireboy and Watergirl. Over several weeks, the 3 of us worked to build the game worlds, implement functions to make
the characters move, add music, and make the game as fun and similar to the original as possible. The game is not perfect, but I am really proud of the work we did and 
hope it inspires others!
